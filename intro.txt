2. It seems like a database should be used when there's lots of data that needs to be stored permanently. A text file should be used when it's a smaller amount of data or the data is only needed for the single procedure. 

3. SQL is declarative rather than procedural. This means that we can focus on what we want to find out, rather than how the database should find it. 

4. The pieces of a database system fit together in a table, made up of columns and rows. Inside each block is a value that is stored in the database and can be pulled with a command. Databases store data in a binary file format. 

5. 

Table: The format a database is stored in
Row: The horizontal part of the table; represent individual data corresponding with the column
Column: In a database, these label what is stored there.
Value: The actual data stored in the cell.
